##Apple Mac Users

	*	Check install: ```$ gcc --version```


4.	__Install homebrew from terminal:__
	*	```$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)```
	*	After install is complete: ```$ brew doctor```
		*	__If you get following error:__ 
		
				"Warning: Experimental support for using Xcode without the "Command Line Tools".

		This will take a few minutes, and once itâ€™s done, quit and relaunch Terminal, then run this command:
	*	```$ type rvm | head -1```
		If you get rvm is a function, that means RVM was successfully installed.
